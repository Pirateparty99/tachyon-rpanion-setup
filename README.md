# tachyon-rpanion-setup
This repo is used to deploy the [Rpanion Server](https://www.docs.rpanion.com/software/rpanion-server) on the [Particle Tachyon](https://www.particle.io/tachyon/) Single Board Computer (SBC). Rpanion Server was created for web-based configuration of vehicles using the [MavLink](https://mavlink.io/) protocol from a companion computer.

###Note 
This repo is by no means a complete project nor is it a rewrite of the Rpanion Server project. It was created as I needed a way to configure Rpanion Server on a Tachyon board.
